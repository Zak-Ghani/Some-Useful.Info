To ensure this rule is followed a scan is carried out to find any Public IP&amp;rsquo;s. Any public IP&amp;rsquo;s found which did not follow any form of exception process are passed on to the security team, where a suitable enforcer is dispatched to help the guilty party remediate the situation.</description><dc:creator>Saquib</dc:creator><media:content url="https://Some-Useful.info//images/RestClientInVSCode/RESTClientInVSCode.png" medium="image"><media:title type="html">featured image</media:title></media:content><category>Rest-Client</category><category>VS-Code</category><category>Azure</category></item></channel></rss>
