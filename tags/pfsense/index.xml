&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>My take on a speedtest widget for pfsense.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Being a newcomer to pfsense I guess i'm still playing catchup, as the newbie when my download speeds are nowhere near what i'm paying for I suspect pfsense as thats the only thing that changed in my setup.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Knowing what my broadband supplier is going to say I pre-empt this by doing my own diagnosis before calling them. I've disconnected everything from the back of my modem and plugged my laptop in directly, gone to &lt;a href="https://www.Speedtest.net">www.Speedtest.net&lt;/a> and hit the 'GO' button. Unfortunately the reading is no different (download speeds still suck).
One thing is for sure: I've just wasted several minutes dismantling a perfectly good hardware install, now I just have a mass of cables near my modem which need to be plugged back in.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
